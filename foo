This is an empty file.
I use this file so that Docker build will copy
files to this directory whether they exist or
not using wildcards. Otherwise Docker build
will fail during copy with specific files. It
needs at least one good file or the entire string
will fail.
You can safely ignore this file. It's just apart
of the automation.
