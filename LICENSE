The Open Source Software license terms are consistent with the License granted in this Agreement, and may contain additional rights benefiting you. The Open Source Software license terms shall take precedence over this Agreement to the extent that this Agreement imposes greater restrictions on you than the applicable Open Source Software license terms. To the extent the license for any Open Source Software requires Illumio to make available to you the corresponding source code and/or modifications (the "Source Files"), you may obtain a copy of the applicable Source Files by sending a written request, with your name and address to: Illumio, Inc., 920 De Guigne Avenue, Sunnyvale, California, United States of America.

5.	Compliance. The Software may be subject to United States export control regulations. Without prior authorization from the United States government, you shall not use the Software for, and shall not permit the Software to be used for, any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, for any prohibited development, design, manufacture or production of missiles or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Without limiting the foregoing, You represent and warrant that: (a) You are not, and are not acting on behalf of, any person who is a citizen, national, or resident of, or who is controlled by the government of, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria, or any other country to which the United States has prohibited export transactions; (b) You are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (c) You are not, and are not acting on behalf of, any person or entity listed on the U.S. Treasury Department list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or the U.S. Commerce Department Denied Persons List, Unverified List, or Entity List or any other U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties unless authorized by license or regulation.

SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, ILLUMIO WILL PERFORM ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
