This is an empty file.
I use this file so that Docker build will copy
files to this directory whether they exist or
not using wildcards. Otherwise Docker build
will fail during copy with specific files. It
needs at least one good file or the entire string
will fail.
You can safely ignore this file. It's just apart
of the automation.

The reason:
You have to specify any optional files for the COPY command with * along with one real file, the COPY command needs to copy at least one file over, even if there is more than one optional file to copy with the * option. So foo is created and the rest are going to be optional but copied if they
exist. This just makes it easy to test multiple types of software in a development environment depending on the type of work being done.
